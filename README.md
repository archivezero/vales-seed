Symbolic operating system for the VALES archive. Core lexicon, visual grammar, project nodes, and dimensional field structure.

# VALES Seed

**The Symbolic Operating System of the VALES Archive**  
*Curated and structured by Jared Vale / archivezero*

This repository contains the core structure and language of the VALES system—a symbolic, dimensional, and perceptual archive built for interface design, pattern logic, and memory attunement.

## 🔑 Primary Concepts

- **Stereoglyphs** – Symbols that reveal meaning through perceptual alignment.
- **Psychic Residue** – Trace states that influence experience at thresholds.
- **The Fold** – A ritual entry system for altering perceptual and symbolic states.
- **Vault Nodes** – Modular memory units linked to dimensional coordinates.
- **Visual Grammar** – Principles guiding visual and structural design.

## 🧭 Intent

This is not a static archive. It is a living interface.  
Clone it. Fork it. Talk to it. Build on it.  
Or simply walk through it slowly—like a field of symbols under morning light.
